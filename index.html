    <h2 class="title subheader">What is this site?</h2>
    <p>You should probably be on acumensyndicate.ca to see this message. This is our, Acumen syndicate's, first website! We're pretty excited about it! Feel free to come back in a month or so to see our first real project. Expected time for project "Hydrogen", our first one, to come out is about mid to late February 2018, so stay tuned! Any changes to the release schedual will be updated on this site</p>
    <h2 class="title">Who is Acumen syndicate?</h2>
    <p>Acumen syndicate is our sort of fake company name, as we aren't registed. We're just a group of friends who's interested in trying out some website development. Acumen is based in Canada, hence the ".ca" domain name. Well, that and there was a discount, on Godaddy, that made ".ca" domains priced at a cheap $1. That's even cheaper than you think, since it's in CAD not USD. Anyways, our secondary goal, other than learning, is reforming a certain site that we believe is undermining its true potential</p>
    <h4 class="subheader">Interested in having a go at some HTML yourself?</h4>
    <p>No problem.<br>
      All you need is a computer, running any OS with broser support and internet connection. To learn HTML/CSS/JS, we use MDN's learning section. It's free and generally great! We highly suggest using it</p>
